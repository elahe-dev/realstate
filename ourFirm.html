                            <p>Labour has always been taxed linearly whilst
                                capital has always enjoyed the power of
                                compounding returns. Unfortunately, more and
                                more policies have been supportive of capital as
                                opposed to labor. Over time, the disparity of
                                wealth has become more visible in society where
                                opportunities to invest capital in some of the
                                best asset classes have been made available to
